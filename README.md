View the full walkthrough here

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. There are so many versions of it it is hard to in down it's exact origin. There are claims that the famuos writer of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain invented his own version. I googled it and whatever it is, it looks more like a way of trying to figure out how much tax you owe rather than match cards.

In this repo, I will be putting extra focus on setting Attributes in JavaScript. If you want to learn how to use setAttritube and getAttribute effectively, please have a look at my code.

I have kept the styling at a bare miniumum for you to go wild and make it your own. Please tag me as I would LOVE to see your game!!!

What inbuilt functions are we going to focus on?
for loops
addEventListener
setAttribute
getAttribute
data-name
document.querySelector
createElement
Rules of Memory Game
You will start by flipping over one card
If the next card you flip matches, a pop up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your score
These cards then disspear
If the next card you flip does not match, a pop up alert notifies you of ths and the cards flip back
The game continues until you match all the cards on the board
